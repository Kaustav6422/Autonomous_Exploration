\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Maps are necessary part of mobile robots, they require it for navigation through environment. To build
maps robots can explore there surroundings using there perception sensors(like laser sensors,
Ultrasonic sensors and camera). Simplest way to explore an area using mobile robot is to give movement
commands to robot(tele-operation) and store the occupancy information of small patches of the environment,
this kind of map is called occupancy grid maps.
\par
Exploration through tele-operation is non-ideal in long distance exploration 'like mars planetary
exploration' due to communication delay, in this scenario autonomous exploration is a use-full
tool to employ.In domestic environments like offices and homes mapping is done to locate objects
present in the room, one major constraint is area coverage. For, maximum coverage the autonomous
explorer must be fast and explore every corner of the environment. Conversely, for an industrial
environment the explorer will have to be accurate, discover every important feature of the map with
calibrated sensors.
\par
Aforementioned constraints are satisfied by different exploration strategies. An \textit{exploration
strategy} is a general method of devising an exploration plan. It is not necessary that a complete
plane is generated before execution, usually explorers follow a analysis-execution loop , in which
they analyze which direction to go and then execute motion according to the direction. A number of
exploration strategies are mention in next section with there advantages. For simplicity we are
concentrating on single robot-exploration, not all but some of the strategies are scale-able to
multi robot teams by adding knowledge sharing to the system.
\par
An exploration plan is simply a series of nodes of a graph connected by edges,
In which each node represents a position(which is a pair of Cartesian-Coordinates in a 2D map)
to be visited by the robot. If the robot visits all nodes in the given sequence,
it has completed exploration according to given plan(for example look at Figure 1).
On the low-level these coordinates can be translated to the series of commands which are to be
executed by drive of the robot, which can vary from robot to robot.
