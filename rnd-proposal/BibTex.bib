@article{Keidar2012,
abstract = {Frontier-based exploration is the most common approach to exploration, a fundamental problem in robotics. In frontier-based exploration, robots explore by repeatedly detecting (and moving towards) frontiers, the segments which separate the known regions from those unknown. A frontier detection sub-process examines map and/or sensor readings to identify frontiers for exploration. However, most frontier detection algorithms process the entire map data. This can be a time-consuming process, which affects the exploration decisions. In this work, we present several novel frontier detection algorithms that do not process the entire map data, and explore them in depth. We begin by investigating algorithms that represent two approaches: Wavefront Frontier Detector (WFD), a graph-search-based algorithm which examines only known areas, and Fast Frontier Detector (FFD), which examines only new laser readings data. We analytically examine the complexity of both algorithms, and discuss their correctness. We then improve by combining elements of both, to create two additional algorithms, called WFD-INC and WFD-IP . We empirically evaluate all algorithms, and show that they are all faster than a state-of-the-art frontier detector implementation (by several orders of magnitude). We additionally contrast them with each other and demonstrate the FFD and WFD-IP are faster than the others by one additional order of magnitude.},

In this paper, an extensive study of the most important methods for autonomous exploration and mapping of unknown environments is presented. Furthermore, a representative subset of these techniques has been chosen to be analysed. This subset contains methods that differ in the level of multi-robot coordination and in the grade of integration with the simultaneous localization and mapping ({\{}SLAM{\}}) algorithm. These exploration techniques were tested in simulation and compared using different criteria as exploration time or map quality. The results of this analysis are shown in this paper. The weaknesses and strengths of each strategy have been stated and the most appropriate algorithm for each application has been determined.},

abstract = {Automatically building maps from sensor data is a necessary and fundamental skill for mobile robots; as a result, considerable research attention has focused on the technical challenges inherent in the mapping problem. While statistical inference techniques have led to computationally efficient mapping algorithms, the next major challenge in robotic mapping is to automate the data collection process. In this paper, we address the problem of how a robot should plan to explore an unknown environment and collect data in order to maximize the accuracy of the resulting map. We formulate exploration as a constrained optimization problem and use reinforcement learning to find trajectories that lead to accurate maps. We demonstrate this process in simulation and show that the learned policy not only results in improved map building, but that the learned policy also transfers successfully to a real robot exploring on MIT campus.},

abstract = { In this paper, we consider the problem of exploring an unknown environment with a team of robots. As in single-robot exploration the goal is to minimize the overall exploration time. The key problem to be solved in the context of multiple robots is to choose appropriate target points for the individual robots so that they simultaneously explore different regions of the environment. We present an approach for the coordination of multiple robots, which simultaneously takes into account the cost of reaching a target point and its utility. Whenever a target point is assigned to a specific robot, the utility of the unexplored area visible from this target position is reduced. In this way, different target locations are assigned to the individual robots. We furthermore describe how our algorithm can be extended to situations in which the communication range of the robots is limited. Our technique has been implemented and tested extensively in real-world experiments and simulation runs. The results demonstrate that our technique effectively distributes the robots over the environment and allows them to quickly accomplish their mission.},

We aim to build a robot that, unsu- pervised, plans its motion such that it continually increases both the spatial extent and detail of its world model - its map. We present a method by which the planned motion at any instant is moti- vated by the geometric, spatial and stochastic char- acteristics of the current map. In particular each feature within the map is responsible for determin- ing nearby unexplored areas that if visited are likely to constitute exploration. We assume that the lo- cation of the features is uncertain and represented by a set of probability distribution functions (pdfs). These distributions are used in conjunction with the robot path history to determine a robot trajec- tory suited to exploration. We show results that demonstrate the algorithm providing real-time ex- ploration of a mobile robot in an unknown environ- ment.},

@article{Gonzalez-Banos2002,
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate safe and efficient map-building strategies for a mobile robot with imperfect control and sensing. In the implementation, a robot equipped with a range sensor builds a polygonal map (layout) of a previously unknown indoor environment. The robot explores the environment and builds the map concurrently by patching together the local models acquired by the sensor into a global map. A well-studied and related problem is the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, where the goal is to integrate the information collected during navigation into the most accurate map possible. However, SLAM does not address the sensor-placement portion of the map-building task. That is, given the map built so far, where should the robot go next? This is the main question addressed in this paper. Concretely, an algorithm is proposed to guide the robot through a series of 'good' positions, where 'good' refers to the expected amount and quality of the information that will be revealed at each new location. This is similar to the next-best-view (NBV) problem studied in computer vision and graphics. However, in mobile robotics the problem is complicated by several issues, two of which are particularly crucial. One is to achieve safe navigation despite an incomplete knowledge of the environment and sensor limitations (e.g., in range and incidence). The other issue is the need to ensure sufficient overlap between each new local model and the current map, in order to allow registration of successive views under positioning uncertainties inherent to mobile robots. To address both issues in a coherent framework, in this paper we introduce the concept of a safe region, defined as the largest region that is guaranteed to be free of obstacles given the sensor readings made so far. The construction of a safe region takes sensor limitations into account. In this paper we also describe an NBV algorithm that uses the safe-region concept to select the next robot position at each step. The new position is chosen within the safe region in order to maximize the expected gain of information under the constraint that the local model at this new position must have a minimal overlap with the current global map. In the future, NBV and SLAM algorithms should reinforce each other. While a SLAM algorithm builds a map by making the best use of the available sensory data, an NBV algorithm, such as that proposed here, guides the navigation of the robot through positions selected to provide the best sensory inputs.},
