\section{Problem Description}

\subsection{Problem Addressed}
Our objective is to implement exploration scheme for ground mobile robot, which enables it to
autonomously explore the given indoor environment using its perception sensors.
Using these laser scans the robot should be able to build a 2D map of the surroundings.
The end result of this endeavor will be a module which is able to devise an exploration plan.
The efficiency of the exploration strategy is also a concern which can be measured using matrices
proposed in \cite{Juliae2012}.
\par
Formally \textit{Occupancy Grid Maps} represent the occupation probability of each zone of the
environment within a grid \cite{Juliae2012}. One of the reasons of choosing a strategy is that
it can work with occupancy grids.
