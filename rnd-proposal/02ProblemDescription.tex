\section{Problem Description}

\subsection{Problem Addressed}
Our objective is to implement exploration scheme for ground mobile robot, which enables it to
autonomously explore the given indoor environment using its perception sensors.
Using these laser scans the robot should be able to build a 2D map of the surroundings .
The end result of this endeavor will be a module which is able to devise an exploration strategy.
The efficiency of the exploration strategy is also a concern which can be measured using matrices
proposed in \cite{Juliae2012}. \par
